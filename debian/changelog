  * Enable ocaml-mode for emacs-snapshot (Closes: #347917).
  * Change the patch added in 3.09.1-2, because it broke ocamlopt -pack on
    sparc (we now filter link options to remove the "-Wl," part, and then use
    ld). Thanks to Sylvain Le Gall for noticing, and to Samuel Thibault for
    his help debugging this (Closes: #351853).

  * build-arch is a phony target.
  * Add patch to make ocamlopt -output-obj and ocamlopt -pack call the linker
    via gcc instead of directly, which allows us to pass the same linking
    options in these cases and in the common case (where ocamlopt already used
    gcc). This should unbreak ocamlopt -pack on alpha, and thus fix the build
    failure of camomile.

  * Add patch by Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org> to fix native code linking
    by passing the --no-relax option to ld (Closes: #338437).
    Bug#335578 stays open since a proper fix to the generated asm would still

  * New upstream stable point version.
    - breaks binary compatibility, we thus have to up the ABI version
      to 3.08.3.
  * New features
    - ignore unknown warning options for forward and backward compatibility
    - runtime: export caml_compare_unordered (PR#3479)
    - camlp4: install argl.* files (PR#3439)
    - ocamldoc: add -man-section option (Closes: #287538)
    - labltk: add the "solid" relief option (PR#3343)
    - compiler: ocamlc -i now prints variance annotations
  * Bug fixes:
    - typing: fix unsoundness in type declaration variance inference.
      Type parameters which are constrained must now have an explicit variant

      compatible, so this might break code which either uses subtyping or

ocaml (3.07.2a-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream .2 release, including the ocaml-3.07-pl2 patch.
  * Removed the otherlibs/num library, since the copyright is non-free, and
    the copyright got lost in the HP/Compaq acquisition. Thanks to Bdale
    Garbee for trying to solve this issue, but since the release approaches,
    and upstream is reimplementing the library anyway, i will remove it here.
  * Fixed broken emacs file caml-types.el. (Closes: #218226)

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Fri, 31 Oct 2003 14:46:02 +0100

ocaml (3.07-5) unstable; urgency=low

    renamed objinfo to ocamlobjinfo, to be more in line with the other ocaml
    executables.
  * Test for emacsen flavor early one and abort if unsupported.
    (Closes: #213862)

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Fri,  3 Oct 2003 17:08:29 +0200

ocaml (3.07-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Arg, dh_gencontrol seems to not support putting stuff after the
    substitution variable, which seems somewhat broken to me, anyway, let's
    put the substitution variable last.

  * Linked to libgdbm-compat, using the new libgdbm-dev package.
    (Closes: #188553)
  * Removed the /etc/magic debconf question, as ocaml is recognized by file
    since version 4.02-1. (Closes: #190037, #189774)
  * Uncommented site specific emacs stuff as suggested by Laurent Bonnaud and
    okeyed by Ralf Treinen. (Closes: #192131)
  * Conflicts with camlidl (<< 1.04), warn if /usr/include/caml is still not
    a symlink, but this should only happen if the user did some hand
    installation.  (Closes: #195574, #192552)

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Sun,  8 Jun 2003 11:52:10 +0200

ocaml (3.06-16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix GC memory problem in stat_aux function in stat.c, reported in upstream
    bug #1665 and causes random SEGVs when using Unix.Largefile.stat or

  * Applied Remi's ocaml_packaging_policy changes. (Closes: #177850)
  * Backported the config/auto-aux/async_io.c patch from CVS, to solve the
    graphics module/sleep problem. (Closes: #179199)

ocaml (3.06-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the (bad) /usr/lib/ocaml/3.06/ld.conf that comes with the ocaml
    package.
  * Now run ocaml-ldconf in ocaml postinst also. This is needed since
    /usr/lib/ocaml/3.06/ld.conf was in ocaml 3.06-13 and will thus be removed
    when we upgradeto 3.06-14.
  * Some script cleanup.

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Dec 2002 00:05:22 +0100

ocaml (3.06-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ocaml and ocaml-base now provides ocaml-3.06-1 and ocaml-base-3.06-1. All
    library packages depending on ocaml-3.06 and ocaml-base-3.06 are now
    uninstallable, and should be rebuilt with these new dependencies. Notice
    that a bug in dpkg (Bug#170825) allows to upgrade ocaml to 3.06-13 even if
    packages depending on the older virtual provides are still present,
    apt-get handles this properly.
  * Changed libdir from /usr/lib/ocaml to /usr/lib/ocaml/3.06, and adapted the
    ocaml_packaging_policy consequently.
  * Added Stefano's section on META files and findlib in the
    ocaml_packaging_policy.
  * Now /usr/include/caml is a symlink to /usr/lib/ocaml/3.06/caml, and not
    the other side around. Need to find a nicer solution here, or even stop
    shipping the headers in /usr/include. One solution would be to ship them
    under /usr/include/ocaml/3.06/caml.

  * Added a debconf template to fill /etc/magic with the appropriate ocaml
    magic.

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Sun, 27 Oct 2002 00:20:24 +0200

ocaml (3.06-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ocaml needed a rebuild, since native code compilation using the Str
    library was broken. I don't really understand what did break, most
    probably it is one of the developpment libraries (binutils, libc6, ...)
    which did change in an incompatible way we are not aware of.
  * Now ship objinfo. (Closes: #165446)
  * Applied odoc_man.ml patch from Maxence i got out of CVS. (Closes: #159581)
  * Removed /usr/lib/ocaml/ld.conf from the ocaml package, since it is shipped
    with ocaml-base. (Closes: #161742)

ocaml (3.06-6.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * (NMU) recompile at maintener request
    Since i uploaded ocam lsource only, ocaml-source was not built,
    so i asked for an NMU, not having the bandwith for uploading ocaml-source
    myself. (Sven Luther)

ocaml (3.06-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * ocaml-ldconf in postrm was called only on remove, not upgrade.
    (Closes: #159859).
  * Moved ocaml-source stuff to /usr/src.
    (Closes: #159862).
  * Added more verbose info to ocaml-ldconf.ml
    (Closes: #159860).
  * Now ocaml-ldconf also accepts the -R option to remove all directories
    associated with the given package.

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Fri,  6 Sep 2002 18:12:18 +0200

ocaml (3.06-5) unstable; urgency=high

ocaml (3.06-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Apparently the dh_ocamlld patch did not do, i will now call ocaml-ldconf
    in ocaml-base.postinst, to be sure the /usr/lib/ocaml/ld.conf is created
    correctly (Closes: #158905).

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Mon,  2 Sep 2002 14:04:17 +0200

ocaml (3.06-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Added a Provide: ocaml-source-3.06 to the ocaml-source control file.
    (Asked by Jerome Marant)

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Fri, 30 Aug 2002 09:39:25 +0200

ocaml (3.06-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Now we create the /usr/local/lib/ocaml directory in the postinst instead
    of including it in the package. We also don't fail if we are not able to
    create this directory (if /usr/local is mounted read-only for example).
    (Closes: #157898)
  * Now use mmap() instead of malloc() for allocation of major heap chunks,
    for alpha (same fix as for the ia64 problem encountered previously).
    (Closes: #158444)

 -- Sven Luther <luther@debian.org>  Thu, 29 Aug 2002 08:26:53 +0200

ocaml (3.06-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream (bugfix) release. (Closes: Bug#139427)
  * 3.05 as released by upstream was broken, i should not have uploaded it (as
    it broke all the libraries) but it was too late when i was made aware of
    the problems with 3.05.
  * Added a statement in the ocaml-source package description that it is _not_
    supposed to be used for building ocaml. (Closes: #150077)
  * Now ship labltk examples and README file. (Closes: #152588)
  * Added ia64 to the list of arches who support the native code compilers.
    (Closes: #157110)

    (Closes: #152237)
  * Camlp4 -where now gives the correct path. (Closes: #155701)

    package. (Closes: #156042, #155428)
  * Updated ocaml_packaging_policy and README.Debian file.
  * ocaml-ldconf now handles directory only lines in /etc/ocaml/ld.donf as the
    add command.

ocaml (3.05-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
  * Now /usr/lib/ocaml/stublibs is the default path for storing dynamic stub
    libraries. We still keep the ocaml-ldconf/dh_ocamlld stuff on, as it may
    still be usefull and for backward compatibility, but we will slowly
    migrate all library packages to use the new path.
  * Some updates to the policy file (standard stublib path, findlib, ...)
  * Now ship labltk examples and README file.
  * This upstream release fixes the bytecode compilers for powerpc (the same
    as the patch applied in 3.04-9) and ia64.

ocaml (3.04-11) unstable; urgency=high

    upstream's CVS (hope it works) (Closes: Bug#134113)
  * Fixed ocaml-ldconf so it would work even if the files did not exist, and
    added two of the ld.conf files as conffiles (not /usr/lib/ocaml/ld.conf,
    which is a install time generated package).
  * Renamed the include files again to /usr/include/caml, as it breaks things
    otherwise.
